# Introduction

This tutorial will walk you through solving Fly.io distributed challenges in Rust: https://fly.io/dist-sys/

This is intended as an entry-level content to discover Rust, hopefully easily approachable by complete Rust beginners.

The [repo](https://github.com/LeBoucEtMistere/DistributedChallenges) structure is the following:
- The folder [distributes_challenges_solution](/distributes_challenges_solution) contains a rust project with the full solution
- The folder [distributes_challenges](/distributes_challenges) contains the initial template to start the workshop 
- The folder [tutorial](/tutorial) contains the sources of this book.
