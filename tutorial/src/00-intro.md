# Introduction

This tutorial will walk you through solving Fly.io distributed challenges in Rust: [https://fly.io/dist-sys/](https://fly.io/dist-sys/)

This is intended as an entry-level content to discover Rust, hopefully easily approachable by complete Rust beginners.

The [repo](https://github.com/LeBoucEtMistere/DistributedChallenges) structure is the following:
- The folder [distributes_challenges_solution](https://github.com/LeBoucEtMistere/DistributedChallenges/tree/main/distributed_challenges_solution) contains a rust project with the full solution
- The folder [distributes_challenges](https://github.com/LeBoucEtMistere/DistributedChallenges/tree/main/distributed_challenges) contains the initial template to start the workshop 
- The folder [tutorial](https://github.com/LeBoucEtMistere/DistributedChallenges/tree/main/tutorial) contains the sources of this book.
- The folder [node_driver](https://github.com/LeBoucEtMistere/DistributedChallenges/tree/main/node_driver) contains a library that handles all the things related to communication with Maelstrom in rust, that your solution shall depend on.
